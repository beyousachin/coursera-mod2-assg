                    Do you really think that it is you who influence your choice of friends? In fact, friends are a present or punishment from God for everything you do! 
                  As you know, you can tell a lot about a person by the friends he or she has. This is definitely true!
                  True friends are our soul relatives, they are our reflection. Even if you think you do not have much in common with your best friends,
                  take a closer look. You will definitely find a lot of things which unite both of you!
